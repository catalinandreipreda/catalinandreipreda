<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Cătălin</h1>
<h3 align="center">I like to code, design and solve problems</h3>

#### About me

I love coding and learning about tech, but for me it's more about people not computers - I want my code to have real impact and help people!

I focus on solving real-world problems, not translating tickets to code.

#### Background
I'm passionate about beautiful UI and accessible UX: I started volunteering in various graphic design roles then I got my first job as a Frontend Developer and now I'm working as a Full-stack Developer. I'm interested in every layer of software development from feature planning, to UX research and UI design, building scalable systems or DevOps.

Apart from the technical skills, communication and collaboration are of great importance to me. I think good developers focus on amplifying their team's effectiveness as much as they focus on clean code and pragmatic problem solving. I'm a big advocate for mentoring and learning from others on my team, pair programming, continuous delivery and design thinking (empathise with the problem - design - test - reiterate & improve).
