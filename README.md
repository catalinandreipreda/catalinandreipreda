#### Fullstack Developer

I enjoy learning new stuff and understanding how things work, but for me it's about people not computers - I'm happiest when my code generates real value for users.
I'm passionate about beautiful UI and accessible UX: I started volunteering in various graphic design roles then I got my first job as a Frontend Developer and now I'm working Fullstack with technologies like Next.js, Node or ASP .NET CORE

Other interests include game development, computer graphics and AI
