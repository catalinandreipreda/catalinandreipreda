#### Full-stack Developer

I always enjoy learning new tools or skills, but for me it's more about people not computers - I enjoy programming the most when the code generates real value or meaningful change. I consider my purpose as a software engineer to be solving problems, not translating tickets to code, so I enjoy working in cross-functional teams where I can learn and use a broad set of skills and technologies to help my team and drive the project forwards.

I have 3 years of working experience in web development using JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Nest, C#, ASP .NET, SQL, MongoDB

I'm passionate about beautiful UI and accessible UX: I started volunteering in various graphic design roles then I got my first job as a Frontend Developer and now I'm working as a Full-stack Developer. I'm interested in every layer of software development from feature planning, to UX research and UI design, building scalable systems or DevOps.

Apart from the technical skills, communication and collaboration are of great importance to me. I think good developers focus on amplifying their team's effectiveness as much as they focus on clean code and pragmatic problem solving. I'm a big advocate for mentoring and learning from others on my team, pair programming, continuous delivery and design thinking (empathise with the problem - design - test - reiterate & improve).

Other interests include game development, computer graphics, AI, music, film & travel
